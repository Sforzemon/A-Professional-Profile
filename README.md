# https://sforzemon.github.io/A-Professional-Profile/

This a new profile made to help promote myself.

Stylistically it is similar to the last, but with a few more tweaks that I wasn't allowed to do with the initial.


The site itself has a multitude of ways to showcase my work:

The header has a dropdown that will take you directly to any of the three portfolio projects I have added.

The contact page has a button that acts as a mailto link
  It also has a button to bring up a PDF of my resume.  Ready for printing and saving to your computer.
  
The footer has social media links to take the view to my Github, linkedIn, and Twitter.

The portfolio page has screen shots of 3 of my featured projects, a small description, and a button to take the user to the appropriate page.
